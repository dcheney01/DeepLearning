# Deep Learning Projects

A collection of deep learning projects completed for CS 474 - Introduction to Deep Learning (Winter 2022). These Jupyter notebooks demonstrate fundamental neural network concepts and advanced deep learning techniques.

## Projects

### `CancerDetector.ipynb`
Medical image analysis using convolutional neural networks for cancer detection and classification.

### `CNN_initialization.ipynb`
Exploration of different weight initialization strategies for convolutional neural networks and their impact on training performance.

### `DeepRL.ipynb`
Deep reinforcement learning implementation showcasing policy gradient methods and value-based learning.

### `Sequence_to_Sequence.ipynb`
Implementation of sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing tasks using RNNs and attention mechanisms.

### `Style_Transfer.ipynb`
Neural style transfer implementation that combines content and artistic style using pretrained CNN features.

### `Transformer.ipynb`
Implementation and analysis of the Transformer architecture for natural language understanding tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **PyTorch/TensorFlow** for deep learning frameworks
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive development
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **CUDA** for GPU acceleration

This was my first comprehensive introduction to neural networks and deep learning, providing hands-on experience with state-of-the-art architectures and techniques.
